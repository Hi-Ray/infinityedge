An automation layer over stormrazor
## Why?
We had to manually update [Universe](https://universe.communitydragon.org/) on [CommunityDragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/), and sometimes we weren't available,
so we would lose out on assets hence infinityedge was born.
Its main purpose its to watch over the frontend of the league of legends pages and download and
upload the assets to universe.
