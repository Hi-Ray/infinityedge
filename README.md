# infinityedge
An automation layer over stormrazor

## Why?
We had to manually update [Universe](https://universe.communitydragon.org/) on [CommunityDragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/), and sometimes we weren't available,
so we would lose out on assets hence infinityedge was born.
Its main purpose its to watch over the frontend of the league of legends pages and download and
upload the assets to universe.

## How to install?
First rename the file `.env.example` to `.env` fill in the details for the samba share
otherwise an error will be thrown about missing environment variables.
Next check `src/index.ts` and verify you have the correct locale.

That's all!

## FAQ
    Q: Why samba?
A: It's what we were given on [CommunityDragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/) hosting.
